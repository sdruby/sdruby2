# SD Ruby

This is the current website for SD Ruby.

This site includes:
- The SD Ruby logo
- Social links:
  - Meetup
  - Slack
  - Google Group
  - Twitter

For now, this site is mainly a placeholder, but we'll build it out over time.

## Getting started

### Clone the app
1. `cd Sites/` (or wherever you like to store projects locally)
2. `git clone git@github.com:sdruby/sdruby2.git`

### Configure the app and bundle install
1. Switch to Ruby 2.7.7 with the Ruby version manager of your choice (this
should happen automatically from the `.ruby-version` file)
4. Bundle your gem dependencies: `bundle install`.

### Launch the app
1. Run `bundle exec foreman start` to launch the app.
